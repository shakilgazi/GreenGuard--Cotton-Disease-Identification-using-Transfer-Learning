# Cotton-Disease-Prediction-DL-Transfer-Learning-

•	This project based on "transfer learning". This system is able to identify if this cotton has the disease or not. Worked independently to analyze, and visualize, the dataset. This project was completed using Python, a library called NumPy and implemented in "Google Colab". 

•	I used Keras and TensorFlow to create a deep learning model. I used "categorical_crossentropy" and "Adam optimizer" to train the model. With the help of "ImageDataGenerator" I rescale the images. 

•	Finally, with the help of "resnet50", my deep learning model was trained to 76 percent accuracy in identifying whether an image is depicting disease or not.
