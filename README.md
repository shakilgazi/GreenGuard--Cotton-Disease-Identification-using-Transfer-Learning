# GreenGuard: Cotton Disease Identification using Transfer Learning 

• Developed a deep learning model using Transfer Learning technique to identify if a cotton plant has a disease or not.

• Worked independently to analyze, visualize and preprocess the dataset using python library NumPy. Implemented the model in Google Colab using Keras and TensorFlow, used categorical_crossentropy as a loss function and Adam optimizer for training the model. Utilized ImageDataGenerator to rescale the images. 

• Achieved an accuracy of 76% in identifying whether an image is depicting disease or not using ResNet50 model.
